# ArchLiquidGlass
This repo is destinated to save all my arch linux ricing configuration. I'm inspiring my self on macOs Liquid Glass thing, and making something similar for linux.

# The idea
The idea of my ricing is to make all apps a little translucent (more to opaque than translucent) without harming the view of the whole system. Of course, i'm trying to reach the balance between aesthetics and productivity. Some functionalities of my ricing are inspired by [Ax-shell](https://github.com/Axenide/Ax-Shell).

# Let's get started
## First things first
First thing to know is that this ricing was built and thought to work on Arch Linux with Hyprland and there's no guarantee that it will work on another distros or WMs. That been said, you're free to download my ricing and customizating it as you wish, i'll try to leave everything really well documented so you can easely modify the default configuration if you want.
